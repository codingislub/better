## 🚀 Let's Get Started!

### Backend Setup (Flask API)

Open PowerShell and let's bring the backend to life:

```powershell
# Navigate to backend
cd d:\better\backend

# Create a virtual environment (your own Python playground!)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Upgrade pip to the latest
python -m pip install -U pip

# Install all the goodies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the server! 🎉
python app.py
```

🎊 **Success!** Your backend is now running at http://localhost:5000

### Frontend Setup (React App)

Open a **new** PowerShell window and let's start the frontend:

```powershell
# Navigate to frontend
cd d:\better\front

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Fire up the dev server! 🚀
npm run dev
```

🌈 **Amazing!** Your app is live at http://localhost:3000

## 🏗️ Architecture Philosophy

**Clean Separation of Concerns:**
- Backend handles all data persistence and business logic
- Frontend focuses on beautiful user experience
- TypeScript ensures type safety across the app
- Vite proxy eliminates CORS headaches during development

**Smart Design Decisions:**
- 📁 JSON file storage: Simple, debuggable, perfect for MVPs
- 🔄 Cascade delete: Keeps your data clean automatically
- 🎯 RESTful API: Standard, predictable, easy to understand
- 🧩 Component-based UI: Reusable, maintainable, scalable

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**"Failed to fetch tasks" error?**
- ✅ Make sure the backend is running on port 5000
- ✅ Check that `python app.py` shows no errors
- ✅ Verify you can access http://localhost:5000/api/health

**Port already in use?**
- 🔧 Edit `app.py`: change `port=5000` to another port
- 🔧 Update `vite.config.ts` proxy to match
